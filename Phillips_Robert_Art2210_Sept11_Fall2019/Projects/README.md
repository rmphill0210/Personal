   I wanted my clock to have basically the same form as a standard analog clock, but introduce a new way to read the clock.  The second hand is read the same way as a generic watch: it rotates and the placement shows how many seconds have ellapsed.  The Hour hand is built into the Second hand though in this form.  Each hour is represented on the second hand, and you determie the hour by looking at the second hand, and the current hour will be a larger number than the others.  Lastly,the minutes are read as the percentage of a filled circle.  As the minutes increase the percentage of the face of the clock is filled; four arcs separating the minutes into 15 minute increments allow for an easy reading of the current minutes.
